MOER - Marginal Operating Emissions Rate in (lbs/MWh)
AER - Automated Emissions Reduction

Simulating a simplified AER system consisting of a refrigerator connected to a smart plug in an electrical outlet.

given a time series of MOERs determining when to turn on and when to turn off the smart plug.
  - You must keep the refrigerator within proper temperature constraints while minimizing CO2 production.


have a 1 hour forecast of the MOER values
Can access historical MOERs
Fridge must stay between 33F and 43F
Fridge running temp -= 10/hr; 200W
Fridge off temp += 5/hr; 0W
Start Temp = 33F
Run timeframe2019-3-1 00:00+00 to 2019-4-1 00:00+00

- Print the total amount of CO associated with the refrigeratorâ€™s energy usage over the
simulation time
- Print the total refrigerator run time
